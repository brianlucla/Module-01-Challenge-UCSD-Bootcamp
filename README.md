# Horiseon Homepage Refactoring (Module-01-Challenge-UCSD-Bootcamp)

## Description

In this project, we were motivated to provide a website that meets accessibility standards, ion order to make our website optimized for search engines. We built this project to provide concise, descriptive, and easily accessible information for those who visit our website or view our source code. Our work helped make both the website and the source code more organized and more conducive for viewing. In addition, it also provided information that our previous rendition of the website did not. From this project, I was able to learn how to make code more organized and accessible, as well as how to format and modify a website to make it more pleasant for the visitors.
